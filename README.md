# üé® Multi-Theme Switcher App

A React + TypeScript web application that supports three distinct visual themes. Each theme modifies the entire user interface, including layout, font, colors, spacing, and more. Built with performance and responsiveness in mind, this app provides a smooth and engaging user experience with persistent theming across sessions.
